# Bookswap System
Django based bookswap system for exchanging used books. The users can upload the books they have and the book the want in return and the system will automatically match with the corresponding user satisfying those requirements. The user can then accept or reject the matching request suggested by the system.

##Working
The user can create listings and the system will show the matches if the listing matches with any other user. The user can then place the request for swap or accept the request from other users.
